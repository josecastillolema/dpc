## Privacy in Big Data

We will be using [ANJANA](https://anjana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), a Python library which allows the application of different anonymity techniques based on a set of identifiers, quasi-identifiers (QI) and a sensitive attribute. 

Among others, the following anonymity techniques can be applied:
 - k-anonymity
 - l-diversity
 - t-closeness
